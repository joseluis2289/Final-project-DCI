## Aim

Optimize the progress of web development students by developing an web application where good references as complementary learning material can be found.
The users can share a link he liked, rate the resource he saw and comment his experience.

The resources can be found depending on:
- [x] its category
- [x] it is payed or not
- [x] the input from search bar
